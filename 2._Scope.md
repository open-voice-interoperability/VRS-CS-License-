# Scope

The Voice Registry System Work Group of the Open Voice Network Technical Committee, at the behest of the Technical Committee, will develop and create a prototype of a minimally-viable Voice Registry System for the platform-agnostic management of explicit voice-based requests to specific voice agent destinations.  This project will require the development of data structures, data formats, and software to enable voice agents from any platform to request and connect to a third-party registered and named voice agent, following an explicit request for that name.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
